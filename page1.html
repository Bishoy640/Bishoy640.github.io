        <h1>Who Was Tutankhamun?</h1>
        <ul>
            <li> Tutankhamun was a boy pharaoh who ruled Egypt from about 1332 to 1323 BCE.</li>
            <li>He became king at around 9 years old and died mysteriously at just 18 or 19.</li>
            <li>Tut was part of the 18th Dynasty, during Egypt’s “New Kingdom” period.</li>
            <li>His reign was short, but important — he restored the old gods after his father, Akhenaten, had forced Egypt to worship only one god (Aten).</li>
        </ul>
       <h1>How Much Gold Was Inside?</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>The most famous item is the solid gold burial mask, which weighs about <b> 11 kilograms</b> (24 pounds) of pure gold.</li>
            <li>The tomb was packed with over 5,000 treasures, many made of solid gold or covered in gold leaf.</li>
            <li>Just his inner coffin was also made of solid gold, weighing around <b style="font-size:larger;"> 110 kilograms</b> (240 pounds).</li>
            <li>In total, archaeologists estimate that hundreds of kilograms of gold were used in the objects from his tomb — worth tens of millions of dollars today (though its historical value is truly priceless!).</li>
            <li>During his period, Egypt wasnt even in its stronger period, it was relatively weak, yet they found all that,<b> CAN YOU IMAGINE?????</b></li>
        </ul>
